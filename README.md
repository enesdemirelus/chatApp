This project is a personal project I worked in my free time as to practise Tkinter, Python and Sockets. I aimed to create a fully functional Chatting Application.

The software includes the following features:

- Selecting a username.
- Displaying the number of users connected to the server.
- Sending and receiving messages.
- Sending and receiving nudges (exactly like MSN).
- Sending and receiving images via links.
- Storing chat history in a text file to view previous messages when the app is reopened (I know that this is not the most secure method :D).
- Deleting chats and chat history.
- Notifications when the app is minimized (only works on macOS).
- Notification and nudge sounds.

Personal Outcomes:

- Learned how to create and use local servers using sockets.
- Improved my ability to create graphical user interfaces with Tkinter.
- Learned how to trigger notifications in macOS.
- Enhanced my skills in using regular expressions.
- Learned how to play sound in Python.
- Gained experience using the ImgurClient API.
- Dependencies: Python, Tkinter, Sockets, Playsound, ImgurClient, re.
